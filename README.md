# Cracking the Egg ðŸ¥š
_Cracking the Egg_ is an interactive Unity scene for the Stanford class EE267: Virtual Reality, taught by Gordon Wetzstein. It puts the player in a futuristic hacking program called an "Egg". In it, physical objects represent keys that can be used to ultimately crack a passcode. Full of music, atmosphere, and a low-poly style, this project was completed in two weeks by Andrew Lee.

This app requires an Oculus Rift CV1.

## Controls
Move around an open area with positional tracking.

Use an Oculus remote:

- D-pad Up acts as a regular click (due to current bug with Button One causing double clicks)
- D-pad Down recenters the screen
- Back button opens OVR Inspector Menu
